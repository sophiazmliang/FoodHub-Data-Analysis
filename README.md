# FoodHub-Data-Analysis
Project for the Applied Data Science Program, MIT Professional Education
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.

### Objective

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.

### Conclusions:
*  Most popular cuisines: American, Japanese, Italian and Chinese. They consists 82.56% (by order count) of the orders.
*  Top 21 restaurants (by order count) occupied 64.12% of the orders.
Top 24 restaurants (by order cost) occupied 67.19% of the total order cost.
*  Over 50% of rated orders are 5-rating.
*  71.18% of the orders are in Weekend.
*  Food preparation time and delivery time among restaurants are consistant.

### Recommendations:

*  Send more promotions on the popular cuisines and restaurants.
*  Involve more restaurants in the popular cuisine types.
*  Weekday delivery time is a problem. Need to further study the reason (traffic, location etc.)
*  Bigger variance on the Weekend delivery time. Need to further study the reason (traffic, location etc.)
*  Most orders are in the lower cost side, send more promotions to encourage/reward customers to order more.
*  Over 70% of the orders are in Weekend, send more promotions to encourage/reward customers to order more in weekday.
*  There are a lot of order without ratings. Should encourage/reward customers to give more ratings.
